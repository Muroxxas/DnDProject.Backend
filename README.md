# Jacob Lavarnway's DnD Project backend

This class library contains the backend functionality for my DnD Web application, including repositories, units of work, user access facades, services & processes, IoC containerization, and more.

**The state of this project is in constant flux! All designs and implementations are subject to change!**

As I discover, study, design, and implement new design patterns, tools, and other things, the software design and implementation of the backend services can and likely *will* change drastically. 
If I discover a major design pattern or tool that I should have implemented, expect a new branch to be created as I practice and attempt to gain experience with this tool.
